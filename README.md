Create PDF from image

The application starts with a very simple window.
At the top, the menu shows three buttons:
•	“Open”: let the user search on the PC for images to elaborate
•	“Convert”: let the user convert images in pdf (it’ll become enable after)
•	“Help”: open the user guide
To search for the images on your device the user can use the button “open” of the menu or can click inside the white window:

When the user uses one of these two method, the application will show an interface that lets the user navigates on his device.
The user can select one or more images at the same time.
When images are selected the application shows a list of the chosen images:

Pay attention at the order of the images, because it will be the order in the pdf file.
The images are ordered by their names, so if you wish to change the order you need to change the names of the single files with Windows Explorer.
When the user selects the images the button “Convert” at the bottom appear, and the button “Convert” in the menu is enabled.

Using one of these two button the user can transform the images in a pdf file.
A new interface will be open to let you chose the name of the new file.
After, if everything goes right it will appear a message and the application will close, otherwise an error message will appear.
